    "In Python, spaces and tabs are used for indentation. The indentations form a fundamental syntax in Python, since it defines the structures of the code. A series of statements with the same indentation forms a code block, such as those in functions and loops. Without proper indentations, the executation of code will lead to ``IndentationError``. Python style guide [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) recommends using 4 spaces per indentation level, which can also be configured for the tabs in most integrated development environments (IDEs). Note that indentations with different numbers of spaces can not be used for the same level. Otherwise, there will be ``TabError``."
