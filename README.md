# think_python_exercise
This repository is for my answers to the exercises in the amazing textbook *Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, 3rd Edition* by Allen B. Downey. The answers are written in a Jupyter Notebook for each chapter. If you find something worth discussing in the contents, please feel free to let me know!

The content of this repository is only for the purpose of personal learning and not for any commercial activity. For the textbook and its original exercise questions, please refer to the official website [Think Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html) by the author Allen B. Downey or the published versions.
